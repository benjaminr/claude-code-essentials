# Debug Code Issues

You are helping debug code issues by analysing errors, understanding stack traces, and providing targeted solutions.

## Input
**Debug Request**: $ARGUMENTS
- **Text Error**: Error message or description
- **Image Path**: Screenshot of error (`.png`, `.jpg`, etc.)
- **File Path**: Specific file to debug
- **Complex Issue**: Use "think:" prefix for extended analysis

## Your Task

Based on the input, perform intelligent debugging:

1. **Input Detection** - Determine if input is text, image, or complex issue
2. **Error Analysis** - Extract and analyse error information
3. **Code Investigation** - Search for related code and trace execution paths
4. **Root Cause Analysis** - Identify the underlying issue
5. **Solution Proposal** - Provide specific fixes and preventive measures

### Special Handling

#### Image Analysis
If input is an image path:
- Use Read tool to view the image
- Extract error messages, stack traces, or UI issues
- Identify file paths and line numbers from screenshots
- Continue with standard debugging process

#### Extended Thinking Mode
If input starts with "think:":
- Engage in deeper analysis for complex problems
- Consider multiple hypotheses
- Trace through complex execution paths
- Provide comprehensive solution strategies

## Debugging Framework

### 1. Error Analysis Phase
- **Error Type**: Identify error category (syntax, runtime, logic, etc.)
- **Stack Trace**: Extract file paths and line numbers (from text or images)
- **Error Message**: Understand what went wrong
- **Context**: Determine when/where error occurs
- **Execution Path**: Trace the code flow leading to the error

### 2. Code Investigation Phase
- **Read Error Location**: Examine code at error location
- **Trace Execution Path**: Follow complete code flow from entry point to error
- **Check Dependencies**: Verify imports and dependencies
- **Review Recent Changes**: Look for recent modifications if relevant
- **Cross-File Analysis**: Trace errors across multiple files and modules
- **Data Flow**: Track how data transforms through the error path

### 3. Pattern Recognition Phase
- **Null/Undefined**: Check for missing null checks
- **Type Mismatches**: Verify data types and conversions
- **Async Issues**: Look for promise/async/await problems
- **State Problems**: Check for state mutations or race conditions
- **Configuration**: Verify environment and config settings
