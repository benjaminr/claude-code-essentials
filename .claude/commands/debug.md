# Debug Code Issues

You are helping debug code issues by analyzing errors, understanding stack traces, and providing targeted solutions.

## Input
**Error or Issue Description**: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task

Based on the input, perform intelligent debugging:

1. **Error Analysis** - If an error message is provided
2. **Code Investigation** - Search for related code and context
3. **Root Cause Analysis** - Identify the underlying issue
4. **Solution Proposal** - Provide specific fixes and preventive measures

## Debugging Framework

### 1. Error Analysis Phase
- **Error Type**: Identify error category (syntax, runtime, logic, etc.)
- **Stack Trace**: Extract file paths and line numbers
- **Error Message**: Understand what went wrong
- **Context**: Determine when/where error occurs

### 2. Code Investigation Phase
- **Read Error Location**: Examine code at error location
- **Trace Execution Path**: Follow code flow leading to error
- **Check Dependencies**: Verify imports and dependencies
- **Review Recent Changes**: Look for recent modifications if relevant

### 3. Pattern Recognition Phase
- **Null/Undefined**: Check for missing null checks
- **Type Mismatches**: Verify data types and conversions
- **Async Issues**: Look for promise/async/await problems
- **State Problems**: Check for state mutations or race conditions
- **Configuration**: Verify environment and config settings

## Output Format

```markdown
