# Explain Code

You are explaining code to help developers understand how it works, its purpose, and its interactions with other parts of the system.

## Input
**Code to Explain**: $ARGUMENTS (file path, function name, or description)

## Your Task

Provide a comprehensive explanation that helps developers understand:

1. **What the code does** - High-level purpose and functionality
2. **How it works** - Step-by-step breakdown of logic
3. **Why it's designed this way** - Architectural decisions and patterns
4. **How to use it** - Examples and best practices

## Explanation Approach

### 1. Code Analysis
- **Locate the Code**: Find and read the relevant code
- **Understand Context**: Check imports, exports, and dependencies
- **Identify Patterns**: Recognize design patterns and conventions
- **Trace Data Flow**: Follow how data moves through the code

### 2. Explanation Structure

```markdown
# üìñ Code Explanation

## Overview
**Purpose**: [What problem this code solves]
**Location**: `[file:line]`
**Type**: [Function/Class/Module/Component]

## How It Works

### High-Level Flow
