# Optimise Performance

You are analysing code for performance bottlenecks and suggesting optimisations to improve speed, memory usage, and scalability.

## Input
**Code to Optimise**: $ARGUMENTS (file path, function name, or component)

## Your Task

Perform comprehensive performance analysis:

1. **Identify Bottlenecks** - Find performance issues
2. **Analyze Complexity** - Time and space complexity
3. **Suggest Optimizations** - Specific improvements
4. **Provide Benchmarks** - Measure improvements

## Analysis Approach

### 1. Performance Audit

#### Time Complexity Analysis
- Loop analysis (nested loops, iterations)
- Recursive calls and depth
- Algorithm efficiency
- Database query performance

#### Space Complexity Analysis  
- Memory allocations
- Data structure choices
- Caching opportunities
- Memory leaks

#### Common Bottlenecks
- N+1 queries
- Unnecessary re-renders
- Blocking operations
- Inefficient algorithms
- Large bundle sizes
